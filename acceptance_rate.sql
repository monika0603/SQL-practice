"""
Weâ€™re given two tables. friend_requests holds all the friend requests made and friend_accepts 
is all of the acceptances.

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of friend requests.

Note: Round results to 4 decimal places.

Example:

Input:

friend_requests table

Column	Type
requester_id	INTEGER
requested_id	INTEGER
created_at	DATETIME
friend_accepts table

Column	Type
acceptor_id	INTEGER
requester_id	INTEGER
created_at	DATETIME
Output:

Column	Type
acceptance_rate	FLOAT
""" 

SELECT COUNT(b.acceptor_id)/COUNT(a.requester_id) AS acceptance_rate 
FROM friend_requests a 
LEFT JOIN friend_accepts b 
ON a.requester_id = b.requester_id AND a.requested_id = b.acceptor_id
