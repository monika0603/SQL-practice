""" 
Letâ€™s say we are given a table user_logins.

Using this table, calculate how many users logged in an identical number of times on January 1st, 2022.

For example, it may be the case that on that date three users logged in seven times, four users logged in five times, two users logged in ten times, etc.

Example:

Input:

user_logins table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
user_id	INTEGER
login_date	DATETIME
Output:

Column	Type
number_of_logins	INTEGER
number_of_users	INTEGER
