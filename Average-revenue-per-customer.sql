Letâ€™s say that we work for a B2B SaaS company that has been around for three years.

The company has two revenue lines (product_type): the first is labeled as "service" and is a 
consulting type model where clients are serviced on an hourly rate for a one-off project. 
The second revenue line is "software", which clients can purchase on an ongoing subscription basis.

Given a table of payments data, write a query to calculate the average revenue per client.

Note: Round the result to two decimals.

Example:

Input:

payments table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
user_id	NTEGER
created_at	DATETIME
amount_per_unit	FLOAT
quantity	INTEGER
product_type	VARCHAR
Output:

Column	Type
average_lifetime_revenue	FLOAT


"""


SELECT CAST(
  (SELECT SUM(amount_per_unit * quantity) FROM payments) / 
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM payments) 
  AS DECIMAL (10, 2)
) AS average_lifetime_revenue;
