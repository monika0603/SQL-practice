""" 
The table products contains data about products that a user purchased. Products are divided into categories. The column id is the primary key of table products and represents the order in which the products are purchased.

Write a query to output a table that includes every product name a user has ever purchased. Additionally, the table should have a boolean column with a value of 1 if the user has previously purchased that product category and 0 if itâ€™s their first time buying a product from that category.

Note: Sort the results by the time purchased ascending.

Example:

Display results like:

product_name	category_previously_purchased
toy car	0
toy plane	1
basketball	0
football	1
baseball	1
Input:

Column	Type
